# Daily Planner

## Description

This application allows user to create a daily work day scheduler for scheduling activities/events during typical work hours (9AM - 5PM). The application keeps track of activities for each hour and color codes the hours based on the current hour of the day. The application will also display the day and date at the top for user reference.

The time-blocks are dynamically generated using jQuery, HTML, and CSS. The date and time is retrieved with the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library. Each time block time value is generated with the Moment.js library.

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

## Usage

To utilize the application, users can enter any information into the time blocks and click the save button. This will save the information entered for that specific time block into local storage. Additional information can be entered into the other time block and saved with the corresponding buttons. This information will persist as the page is reloaded.

Information can also be edited/changed and saved again, which will rewrite the information in local storage. When the page is reloaded, the current hour block will be highlighted red to notify the user of current hour in the local time zone. Hours that have past will be colored grey while hours in the future will be colored green.

## Credits

- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) was used throughout this project to get the proper time in order to dynamically generate the html time blocks as well as check the current date and hour.
